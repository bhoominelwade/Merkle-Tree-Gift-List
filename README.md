# Merkle-Tree-Gift-List

Overview

This project addresses blockchain's storage challenges by leveraging Merkle treesâ€”a robust data structure for efficient data verification and storage. My focus is on building a gift distribution application that minimizes server memory usage while ensuring secure verification of names on a list.
